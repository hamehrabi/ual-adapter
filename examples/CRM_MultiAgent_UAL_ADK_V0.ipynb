        "- **`torch`** - PyTorch deep learning framework (the engine that runs the models)\n",
        "- **`accelerate`** - Makes model loading faster and handles GPU/CPU distribution\n",
        "- **`sentencepiece`** & **`protobuf`** - Required for tokenization (breaking text into model-readable pieces)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Agent Orchestration & Visualization:\n",
        "- **`google-genai`** - Google's Gemini API client for the planner/router agent\n",

        "\n",
        "Context: A global B2B SaaS organization uses Salesforce to manage 15k open opportunities per quarter. Sales Operations needs a no-code/low‑code automation that 1) standardizes field updates, 2) routes approvals based on deal size, 3) enforces legal review for specific industries, and 4) posts real‑time status in Slack.\n",

        "1) Entry Criteria: AND(ISPICKVAL(StageName,\"Proposal/Price Quote\"), TEXT(Rating)=\"Hot\", AnnualRevenue__c > 1000000, NOT(ISBLANK(Amount))). Add a Decision node “DealTier” with outcomes: Under_50k (Amount < 50000), Mid_50_500k (BETWEEN 50–500k), Over_500k (>500k).\n",
        "2) Field Updates: Compute Days_In_Stage__c = TODAY() – Stage_Enter_Date__c. Set SLA_Target_Date__c = NOW() + CASE(DealTier, Under_50k, 1, Mid_50_500k, 2, Over_500k, 3, 2) business days. Use a subflow to normalize discount fields and lock negative margin deals.\n",
        "3) Approval Routing:\n",
        "   • Under $50k → Manager_Approval_Queue\n",
        "   • $50–500k → Regional_Director_Queue\n",
        "   • >$500k → VP_Approval_Queue + parallel Legal_Review (Platform Event “LegalReviewRequested__e” with payload {OppId, Industry, Discount}).\n",
        "4) Slack Notifications: Outbound message to Slack webhook with markdown summary and deep links. Post updates when Approval Status changes (use Platform Events or Change Data Capture to avoid recursion).\n",
        "5) Guardrails: Turn on “Optimize for Large Data Volumes,” set Flow Trigger Order < 50 to play nicely with MDM sync flows, and wrap DML‑heavy paths in Scheduled Paths to reduce transaction time.\n",

        "Validation & Observability: Create a custom object Flow_Audit__c to log Flow version, outcome path, actor, and execution time (ms).

        "\n",
        "Outcome: Median approval turnaround drops from 14h to 3.2h for sub‑$50k, and from 3 days to 22h for >$500k deals; legal throughput improves due to event‑driven parallelization.

        "   • SLA timers: use “Set property value after delay” for escalations; create a secondary branch to notify Partner Manager if SLA > 3 business days.\n",
        "4) Validation: Custom coded action (Node.js) checks for date overlaps and duplicate co‑sell records via HubSpot API before approval. Failed validation writes an error note and reassigns to submitter.\n",

        "Context: Marketing needs to sync webinar registrants from a third‑party platform into HubSpot Contacts and a custom object “Webinar_Attendance,” at scale (50k/day) with strict SLA and no duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective: Implement an OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, robust token refresh, and idempotent batch upserts using HubSpot’s batch endpoints with backoff, retries, and dead‑letter handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementation:\n",
        "1) OAuth: Store client_id/secret in KMS. Use short‑lived access tokens (~6h) and long‑lived refresh tokens. Build a refresh flow that proactively renews at T‑5 minutes; if refresh fails, alert via PagerDuty.\n",
        "2) Idempotency: Generate deterministic external ids like sha256(email|webinar_id). Use batch create/update endpoints in 100‑record pages. Maintain a “sync watermark” by event timestamp.\n",
        "3) Error Handling:\n",
        "   • 4xx validation errors → write to DLQ (BigQuery table) with payload and reason, auto‑open a JIRA ticket for schema drift.\n",
        "   • 429 / 5xx → exponential backoff (jittered), retry up to 5 times, then DLQ.\n",
        "   • Partial failures → retry only failed rows.\n",
        "4) Data Quality: Normalize emails, enforce ISO8601 timestamps, map UTM fields consistently, and validate country codes against ISO‑3166.\n",
        "5) Observability: Emit metrics (ingested, updated, DLQ) and P95 latency to Prometheus; Grafana board shows hourly trends.\n",

        "1) Event Design: Define OpportunityUpdated__e and ContractSigned__e with minimal payload (ids + version + change mask). Keep the canonical record off‑event; subscribers re‑hydrate as needed.\n",
        "2) Publishing: Use after‑save triggers or flows to publish events only on materially significant changes, batching when possible. Include ReplayId handling for at‑least‑once delivery.\n",
        "3) Middleware: Route events to microservices via topics with consumer groups. Persist to a compacted topic for latest‑state lookups.\n",
        "4) Circuit Breakers: In Apex callouts and in middleware, implement timeouts, bulkheads, retry with backoff, and open/half‑open states when downstream SLAs degrade. Surface breaker state to an Ops dashboard.\n",
        "5) Error Handling: Poison message queues for non‑recoverable cases; dead‑letter with full headers and correlation ids. Provide a replay utility for targeted reprocessing.\n",

        "2) Economic Buyer: Identify EB by budget authority and strategic initiative ownership; confirm via org chart and calendar access. Secure a 30‑minute “value hypothesis” review and capture an endorsement quote.\n",
        "3) Decision Criteria: Map technical (security, uptime, TTV), commercial (TCO 3 years), and relationship factors (local support). Score against competing options using a weighted rubric and share transparently.\n",
        "4) Decision Process: Timeline with stage gates (pilot → security review → legal → CFO). Define exit criteria for each stage and the documents needed.\n",
        "5) Paper Process: Pre‑align redlines with Legal; propose mutual NDA, data‑processing addendum, and order form structure before the final sprint to avoid last‑minute stalls.\n",

        "1) Value Model: Build a driver tree linking product levers (automation hours saved, conversion lift, churn reduction) to EBITDA. Calibrate with customer inputs and sensitivity ranges.\n",
        "2) Tiers: Good‑Better‑Best with a “decoy” tier that nudges selection (e.g., mid tier offers 80% of flagship features; top tier adds governance and analytics). Meter limits match willingness to pay.\n",
        "3) Fences: Role‑based access and compliance features reserved for enterprise to preserve ARPU. Publish overage rates that are predictable and fair.\n",
        "4) Packaging Rules: Bundle features that create complementarity; unbundle high‑value analytics as add‑ons.\n",
        "5) Negotiation: Use ROI proof (payback < 6 months) to defend list. Convert discount asks into earned concessions (longer term, case study, reference calls).\n",

        "• Budget: Quantify opportunity cost (“A 2‑point churn improvement equals $X ARR this quarter”). Present phased rollout to align spend with realized value.\n",
        "• Priority: Tie to CEO agenda; show cost of delay. Propose a pilot that runs in parallel, not instead of other initiatives.\n",
